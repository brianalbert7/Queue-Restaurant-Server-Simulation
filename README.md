# Queue-Restaurant-Server-Simulation
(Data Structures) A simulation of a restaurant. The customers and servers each have a queue, making the order of who serves each customer fair, making sure the first customer in is also the first customer to be served.

Customer.java is the Customer class. This file was written by Professor Stephen T. Brower.

EmptyQueue.java creates an empty queue exception. This file was written by Professor Stephen T. Brower.

Node.java creates generic nodes. This file was written by Brian Albert

Project03QueuesSum18.java runs a simulation using the queue. Written by Professor Stephen T. Brower.

Queue.java is a generic queue that includes add, remove, and size methods. Written by Brian Albert

RunTestQueueWithCustomer.java performs a test on the generic queue to see if it is working properly. Written by Stephen T. Brower.

Server.java is the Server class. This file was written by Professor Stephen T. Brower.

SimulationUsingQueueOfCustomers.java is another simulation using the queue, customer, and server classes. Written by Stephen T. Brower. Brian Albert added the server class and used it to complete the simulation.

SimulationUsingQueueOfCustomersExpress.java is a simulation with regular and express servers. If the customer has less than or equal to 60 work to do, they will be given to an express server. More than 60 work to do and that customer is paired with a regular server. This file was written by Brian Albert.

SimulationUsingQueueOfCustomersMultiple.java uses an array of servers to run a simulation with multiple servers. This file was written by Brian Albert.

TestQueueGeneric.java is the class used with RunTestQueueWithCustomer.java to test a generic queue.
